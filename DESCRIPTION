Description: This package contains many of the vignettes for the survival 
    package, along with some optional datasets used in those vignettes. 
    Since survival is a recommended package, the documentation is required to be 
    completely "vanilla".  In particular, the survival package vignettes use 
    Sweave rather than knitr or markdown, and no other packages outside the 
    base + recommended set can be referenced.  Splitting vignettes into this 
    package overcomes this, and also allowed the survival package itself to 
    be a smaller object.
