Description: Vignettes for the survival package. 
    Since survival is a recommended package, the documentation is  
    required to be completely "vanilla". In particular, the survival package  
    vignettes use Sweave rather than knitr or markdown, and no other packages  
    outside the base + recommended set can be referenced. Splitting vignettes  
    into this package overcomes this, and also allowed the survival package  
    itself to be a smaller object.
