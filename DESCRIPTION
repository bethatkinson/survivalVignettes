Description: This package contains many of the vignettes for the survival package,
 along with some optional data sets used in those vignettes. 
 Since survival is a recommended package, the documentation is required to be 
 completely "vanilla".  In particular, the survival package vignettes use 
 Sweave rather than knitr or markdown, and no other packages outside the 
 base + recommended set can be referenced.  Splitting vignettes into this 
 package overcomes this, and also allowed the survival package itself to 
 be a smaller object.
