Description: Vignettes for the survival package. 
    Split from the survival package since the vignettes were getting large.  
    Also, since survival is a recommended package it cannot make use of other 
    packages outside of base+recommended.  This includes markdown vignettes 
    and the GEE model used in the pseudo vignette.
